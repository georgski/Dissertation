Abstract
============
Over the years, computer and console games have achieved a high level of photorealism and
sophistication of the behaviour of non-player characters. However, due to the hardware limitations
of mobile devices, there is a noticeable lack of games featuring intelligent enemies in mobile game
markets.
In order to develop a highly competitive game, a number of artificial intelligence techniques
have been implemented and optimised specifically for devices of lower computational power to
create realistically acting agents. These techniques include simple, as well as more complex methods, based on relatively recent publications and approaches used by advanced and well-known
computer and console games. The agentsâ€™ decision-making process is controlled by finite state
machines and involves the use of fuzzy logic and terrain analysis. Moreover, the game implements
a robust navigation system capable of moving agents under various conditions and coordinated enemy formations using a method inspired by the Markov process for danger assessment.
